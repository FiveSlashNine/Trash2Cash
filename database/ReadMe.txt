Use the sql file to create the necessary databases.
Set your ip on the network_security_config.xml and the OkHttpHandler.java file.
In the OkHttpHandler.java file you can change the name of the main directory by changing the path const.
The default name of that directory is "trash2cash".
You also need to create that directory and ensure that all the php processes have the necessary permissions to create directories in that directory.
After creating the main directory on your server, simply move the "recyclableMaterialTypes" directory into it by copying and pasting.
